        <p>"Unspoken Voices" is a representation of my internal turmoil of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), transformed into a visual clarity.  Uncontrolled, intrusive, haunting memories are common symptoms of PTSD. Using the human form my sculptures create a visual narrative of pain and resilience in relation to these memories.<br> 
       My body is sculpted as an important carrier of these emotions. "Unspoken Voices" exists as a dualistic representation of myself, confronting these stirring memories, in attempt to heal. I have manipulated the sculptural form to blur the boundaries of the self as a singular stable being, achieved by hypothetically splitting the mind and body.<br>
       "Unspoken Voices" represents the personal healing of trauma on a continuum. This is expressed by figure 2 crouching toward its own haunting memory, and reaching out in a gesture of growth. It provides a visual and communicative link between the physical body and the traumatic memory. These memories totter between remembrance and erasure, shown by the deterioration of the skinâ€™s surface in figure 1 and the bruise-like patina, providing bodily evidence of the trauma endured.<br>
        My work offers a reflection on the experiences of those who have encountered emotional and physical traumas, and aims to bring awareness to these personal battles. Using art as a practice for expression, "Unspoken Voices" allows us to visualize the mind and body in a vulnerable duality while showcasing personal growth.<br><br><br>
